## 🎉 Features

* ⚡️ Quickly visit your favorite websites and search queries instantly
* 🤔 Query using AI or a search engine seamlessly. As of 22/07/24, DuckDuckGo AI supports GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude 3 Haiku, Llama 3 70B & Mixtral 8x7B. This will likely change very often.


## 🛠️ Setting up

Depending on your web browser, the setup will be slightly different.

1️⃣ Go to your browser's **settings** and set the startup page, home page, and find a suitable plugin/setting to set up the [new tab page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna/) to [Auxiliatrium's URL](https://spectrixdev.github.io/Auxiliatrium/)

2️⃣ That's literally all there is to it. You're all set! 🎉

## 🤔 Tips:

* 👉 Click a button without searching for anything, and it will take you to that website's homepage
* 👉 Clicking a button with text in the search bar, you will get results from that website if possible
* 👉 For certain buttons such as Reddit you can do `r/{subreddit name here}` to go to the desired subreddit
* 👉 When clicking the AI button (the robot), the text will be copied to your clipboard. You can then instantly paste it and get your answer. You can also click the top left "search" button on DuckDuckGo to switch from the AI chat to the search results.
